      I am because you are 
An African Philosophy
Today, it can not be related to Africa alone
The world has become a village
Just in one ball called a globe
Races, languages, people 
Have been bonded by single course, 
to fight or stand against an evil, 
to stand with and encourage good
I am because you are
Its human acknowledgement of wants, needs
That we all need everything
 and not anything to survive
We need the love, warmth and care
That genuine concern bring
We all need to share in the pains and joys of others 
So we can truly live and breathe
I am because you are
It makes all the difference
When I understand that I am not alone
And you understand that I am for you
We will all emerge stronger because that makes all the difference.

Over hundreds of centuries of growth and decline of various civilization ( from Sumerian, Babylon, to Roman, to Greece, to Egypt). Human beings have been closely knitted together by the cultures and traditions of the society in which they find themselves, from the primitive nature of such society to those who are  advanced in science and technology.
Historically, it has been noted by various scholars that human societies do not develop parallel of themselves, sometimes one society  widely borrows from another and make improvement upon it. As the years go by man has gradually evolved means to interact better with one another beyond physical gatherings via various media such as the mass media( newspaper, magazine) and electronic media(radio, television). Man is a social being who relies on other humans, even animals and plant which are his food for survival. It is an undisputed fact that man is a social, economic, political and (religious) being who perpetually survives out of others from birth to maturity where he is able to fend for another. Man in this case is used to refer to both gender of humanity.
Technologically,  the world has been webbed into a global village where we can freely interact with people from different climes regardless of race, culture, tradition which has tremendously enable people to share in various courses of their interest.
Earlier on this year, the whole world had been thrown into a season of panic and travail by the covid 19 pandemic which neither spared race nor location.  It goes a long way to show how vulnerable to pain every human being is, as such we all need each other to survive even in our profession, the trader needs the Doctor to survive even as the Doctor needs the trader in order to ensure sustenance.
Ubuntu does not just cut across boundaries of race but also of politics ,of the political structure that there is no leader without followers. It is a popular saying that “ he who walks alone is not a leader but only taking a stroll in the park”. Effective leadership according to leadership experts such as Myles Munroe and John C. Maxwell requires influence. No one influences his self alone by his policies rather he influences the people around him as such a leader exists because there are followers. If this is being taken into consideration especially in Africa, we will be able to develop systems that works for us all that we will equally benefit from as leaders and followers alike.
Economically, in today’s economy there is no Nation that can be said to be economically independent. Economic giants such as the US, China, Britain and Sweden still needs other nations to survive in terms of raw materials and agriculture which is the mainstay of an economy. Nations in the international system engage in the exchange of goods and services in order to earn as well as achieve trade balance. No nations lacks everything nor has everything ranging from man power to technology to natural resources, this gives more ground for us to understand that there is a big nation because there is a small nation. What ever make a man different is because another man has what he does not have. As human we inter- depend.
Socially, a society is a group of people who live together, the basic unit of the society is the family where individuals bond together. Today, society has expanded beyond the confines of our immediate or extended family, even the rural community to include the association in which an individual belongs to; it could be of age grade, of profession or even of a common interest( such as persons who shares same views on a single subject) example human rights, child abuse, good quality of life, quality education for the less privileged etc. Who teem up together to fight a societal wrong or pursue a good course, they are bonded by that single course in which the lend their voices.
To say that Ubuntu is an African philosophy thus relative only to Africa or deemed impracticable is to say that a society, a nation is non- existent because we all need each other to survive. We can rightly put these two proverbs side by side“ I think therefore I am” and “ I am because you are”. A thinking being exists because there is another thinking being for him to reason with, to strategize processes, provide solutions to problems and work towards their advancement together. If as human we all see the need for each other and look out for ourselves with the basic understanding that what makes us human is our brothers, our sisters not minding the barriers of races, ethnicity and religion and understand that we are all we have, the world will truly be a better place to live.
